## Welcome to Encryption-Decryption-System

This is B.Tech. **Major project** - I developed by me. It is a GUI based application, which is developed for making secure message by using cryptography **encryption decryption algorithms**. Encryption is the process of converting normal message (plaintext) into meaningless message (Ciphertext). Whereas Decryption is the process of converting meaningless message (Ciphertext) into its original form (Plaintext).

## Project Objective 

The project are to create a system that can **protect electronic data** (secret information) which Consist of encryption and decryption process and to fully design an encryption and decryption algorithm. 
The objectives of this project is to understand how the Encryption and Decryption process and to make secure message by using encryption.
Encryption-Decryption system is the process by which information can not be detect by the unauthorized person. The information can not be recognizing by the national foe because this system is using the process to encrypt data and decrypt data.

## Technology Used:

1. Python 3.8
2. Python eel for modern GUI
3. Database : MySQL
4. HTML, CSS , JavaScript
5. Editor : Visual Studio Code
